## Complex Numbers

### Definition

A complex number has the form: **z = a + bi**

Where:
- **a** = real part (Re(z))
- **b** = imaginary part (Im(z))
- **i** = √(-1) (imaginary unit)

### Key Properties

**Conjugate:** z* = a - bi

**Modulus:** |z| = √(a² + b²)

**Polar Form:** z = r·e^(iθ) where r = |z| and θ = arg(z)

### Euler's Formula

**e^(iθ) = cos(θ) + i·sin(θ)**

Special cases:
- e^(iπ) = -1 (Euler's identity)
- e^(i·π/2) = i
- e^(i·2π) = 1

### Why Complex Numbers in Quantum Computing?

- **Amplitudes** are complex numbers (quantum state coefficients)
- **Phases** encode quantum interference (constructive/destructive)
- **Probabilities** = |amplitude|² (Born rule)

**Example in Code:**
```fsharp
open System.Numerics

// Create complex amplitude
let alpha = Complex(1.0 / sqrt(2.0), 0.0)  // 1/√2
let beta = Complex(0.0, 1.0 / sqrt(2.0))   // i/√2

// Probability = |amplitude|²
let probability = alpha.Magnitude * alpha.Magnitude  // 0.5
```

---

## Vectors and Vector Spaces

### Definition

A **vector** is an ordered list of numbers (real or complex).

**Example:** v = [1, 2, 3] or in column form:
```
v = | 1 |
    | 2 |
    | 3 |
```

### Vector Operations

**Addition:** u + v = [u₁+v₁, u₂+v₂, ...]

**Scalar Multiplication:** c·v = [c·v₁, c·v₂, ...]

**Zero Vector:** 0 = [0, 0, ...]

### Quantum State as Vector

A **qubit state** is a 2D complex vector:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ where |0⟩ = [1]  and  |1⟩ = [0]
                              [0]            [1]
```

**Normalization:** |α|² + |β|² = 1 (Born rule)

**Example in Code:**
```fsharp
// |+⟩ state = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
let plusState = 
    [| Complex(1.0 / sqrt(2.0), 0.0)
       Complex(1.0 / sqrt(2.0), 0.0) |]

// Verify normalization
let norm = plusState |> Array.sumBy (fun c -> c.Magnitude ** 2.0)
// norm = 1.0 ✓
```

---

## Dirac Notation

### Ket: |ψ⟩ (Column Vector)

Represents a quantum state:

```
|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩ = [α]
                     [β]
```

### Bra: ⟨ψ| (Row Vector)

The conjugate transpose of a ket:

```
⟨ψ| = (|ψ⟩)† = [α* β*]
```

### Computational Basis States

**Single Qubit:**
```
|0⟩ = [1]    |1⟩ = [0]
      [0]          [1]
```

**Two Qubits:**
```
|00⟩ = [1]   |01⟩ = [0]   |10⟩ = [0]   |11⟩ = [0]
       [0]          [1]          [0]          [0]
       [0]          [0]          [1]          [0]
       [0]          [0]          [0]          [1]
```

### Common Superposition States

**|+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2** (Hadamard of |0⟩)

**|−⟩ = (|0⟩ − |1⟩)/√2** (Hadamard of |1⟩)

**|i⟩ = (|0⟩ + i|1⟩)/√2** (Y-basis state)

### Example in Code:
```fsharp
// Create |+⟩ state using Dirac notation semantics
let ket0 = [| Complex.One; Complex.Zero |]
let ket1 = [| Complex.Zero; Complex.One |]

let ketPlus = 
    Array.map2 (fun a b -> (a + b) / Complex(sqrt(2.0), 0.0)) ket0 ket1
```

## Matrices and Linear Transformations

### Definition

A **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers. An **m × n** matrix has m rows and n columns.

### Matrix Multiplication

**(AB)ᵢⱼ = Σₖ Aᵢₖ·Bₖⱼ**

**Note:** AB ≠ BA in general (not commutative)

### Identity Matrix

**I** leaves vectors unchanged:

```
I₂ = [1 0]    I₃ = [1 0 0]
     [0 1]         [0 1 0]
                   [0 0 1]
```

### Quantum Gates as Matrices

Quantum gates are **unitary matrices** that transform qubit states.

**Pauli X (NOT gate):**
```
X = [0 1]    X|0⟩ = |1⟩
    [1 0]    X|1⟩ = |0⟩
```

**Hadamard:**
```
H = 1/√2 [1  1]    H|0⟩ = |+⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
         [1 -1]    H|1⟩ = |−⟩ = (|0⟩ − |1⟩)/√2
```

**Pauli Z (Phase Flip):**
```
Z = [1  0]    Z|0⟩ = |0⟩
    [0 -1]    Z|1⟩ = −|1⟩
```

### Example in Code:
```fsharp
// Apply Hadamard gate
open FSharp.Azure.Quantum.LocalSimulator

let state = StateVector.init 1  // |0⟩
let afterH = Gates.applyH 0 state  // H|0⟩ = |+⟩
```

---

## Inner Products and Orthogonality

### Inner Product (Dot Product)

For complex vectors u and v:

**⟨u|v⟩ = Σᵢ uᵢ* · vᵢ**

**Properties:**
- ⟨u|v⟩* = ⟨v|u⟩ (conjugate symmetry)
- ⟨u|u⟩ ≥ 0 (positive definite)
- ⟨u|u⟩ = 0 iff u = 0

### Orthogonality

Two vectors are **orthogonal** if: **⟨u|v⟩ = 0**

**Computational basis states are orthogonal:**
```
⟨0|0⟩ = 1    ⟨0|1⟩ = 0
⟨1|0⟩ = 0    ⟨1|1⟩ = 1
```

### Norm (Length)

**||v|| = √⟨v|v⟩ = √(Σᵢ |vᵢ|²)**

A vector is **normalized** if ||v|| = 1.

### Born Rule

The probability of measuring state |ψ⟩ and obtaining outcome |i⟩:

**P(i) = |⟨i|ψ⟩|²**

**Example:**
```
|ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2

P(0) = |⟨0|ψ⟩|² = |1/√2|² = 1/2
P(1) = |⟨1|ψ⟩|² = |1/√2|² = 1/2
```

---

## Tensor Products

### Definition

The **tensor product** (⊗) combines two vector spaces into a larger space.

For vectors u = [u₁, u₂] and v = [v₁, v₂]:

```
u ⊗ v = [u₁·v₁]
        [u₁·v₂]
        [u₂·v₁]
        [u₂·v₂]
```

### Multi-Qubit States

Two qubits: **|ψ⟩ ⊗ |φ⟩ = |ψφ⟩**

**Example:**
```
|0⟩ ⊗ |1⟩ = |01⟩ = [1] ⊗ [0] = [0]
                     [0]   [1]   [1]
                                 [0]
                                 [0]
```

### Tensor Product of Matrices

For matrices A (m×n) and B (p×q), A ⊗ B is (mp × nq):

```
A ⊗ B = [a₁₁·B  a₁₂·B  ...]
        [a₂₁·B  a₂₂·B  ...]
        [  ...    ...    ]
```

**Example:** CNOT gate
```
CNOT = |0⟩⟨0| ⊗ I + |1⟩⟨1| ⊗ X = [1 0 0 0]
                                   [0 1 0 0]
                                   [0 0 0 1]
                                   [0 0 1 0]
```

### Entangled States

**Bell state:** |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2

**Cannot** be written as |ψ⟩ ⊗ |φ⟩ for any single-qubit states → **entangled**

**Example in Code:**
```fsharp
// Create Bell state: (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
let state = StateVector.init 2  // |00⟩
let afterH = Gates.applyH 0 state  // (|00⟩ + |10⟩)/√2, writing qubit 0 first
                                   // (basis indices 0 and 1: the library stores qubit 0 in bit 0)
let bellState = Gates.applyCNOT 0 1 afterH  // (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
```

---

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

### Definition

For matrix A, vector v is an **eigenvector** with **eigenvalue** λ if:

**A·v = λ·v**

The eigenvector's direction is unchanged by A, only scaled by λ.

### Spectral Decomposition

Any Hermitian matrix H can be written as:

**H = Σᵢ λᵢ |vᵢ⟩⟨vᵢ|**

Where λᵢ are eigenvalues and |vᵢ⟩ are eigenvectors.

### Measurement in Quantum Mechanics

Measuring observable O (Hermitian operator):
- Possible outcomes: eigenvalues of O
- Probability of outcome λᵢ: |⟨vᵢ|ψ⟩|²
- State after measurement: |vᵢ⟩ (collapsed)

**Example: Measuring in Z-basis**
```
Z = [1  0]   eigenvalues: λ₀ = +1, λ₁ = -1
    [0 -1]   eigenvectors: |0⟩, |1⟩

Measure |ψ⟩ = (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2:
P(+1) = |⟨0|ψ⟩|² = 1/2 → outcome +1, state collapses to |0⟩
P(-1) = |⟨1|ψ⟩|² = 1/2 → outcome -1, state collapses to |1⟩
```

## Unitary and Hermitian Operators

### Unitary Operators

An operator U is **unitary** if:

**U†·U = U·U† = I**

Where U† is the conjugate transpose (adjoint).

**Properties:**
- Preserves inner products: ⟨U·u|U·v⟩ = ⟨u|v⟩
- Preserves norms: ||U·v|| = ||v||
- Reversible: U⁻¹ = U†

**All quantum gates are unitary** (except measurement).

**Example:**
```
Hadamard: H† = H and H·H = I → H is unitary (and self-inverse)
```

### Hermitian Operators

An operator H is **Hermitian** (self-adjoint) if:

**H† = H**

**Properties:**
- Eigenvalues are real
- Eigenvectors are orthogonal
- Used for observables (measurable quantities)

**Example:**
```
Pauli matrices X, Y, Z are Hermitian:
X† = X, Y† = Y, Z† = Z
```

### Example in Code:
```fsharp
// All gates in this library are unitary
// Applying gate then its inverse returns to original state
let state = StateVector.init 1
let afterX = Gates.applyX 0 state  // Apply X
let back = Gates.applyX 0 afterX   // Apply X again (X⁻¹ = X)
// back = state ✓
```

## Hilbert Spaces

### Definition

A **Hilbert space** is a complete vector space with an inner product.

**For quantum computing:**
- Single qubit: ℂ² (2-dimensional complex Hilbert space)
- n qubits: ℂ^(2ⁿ) (2ⁿ-dimensional space)

### Basis

A **basis** is a set of linearly independent vectors that span the space.

**Computational basis** for n qubits:
```
{|0...00⟩, |0...01⟩, |0...10⟩, ..., |1...11⟩}
```

**Any state** can be written as:
```
|ψ⟩ = Σᵢ cᵢ|i⟩
```
where |i⟩ are basis states and Σᵢ|cᵢ|² = 1.

### State Space Growth

| Qubits | Dimensions | Classical Bits Equivalent |
|--------|-----------|---------------------------|
| 1      | 2         | 1 bit                     |
| 2      | 4         | 2 bits                    |
| 3      | 8         | 3 bits                    |
| 10     | 1,024     | 10 bits                   |
| 20     | 1,048,576 | 20 bits                   |
| 50     | 1.13×10¹⁵ | 50 bits                   |
| 100    | 1.27×10³⁰ | 100 bits                  |

**Exponential growth** is why quantum computers are powerful (and hard to simulate).
