# Topological Bell State Program
# This program creates a Bell state using Ising anyons (Majorana zero modes)
#
# Bell state: (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2
#
# Topological implementation:
# 1. Initialize 4 sigma anyons (creates 2 topological qubits)
# 2. Braid anyons 0-1 (applies phase to first qubit)
# 3. Braid anyons 2-3 (applies phase to second qubit)
# 4. Measure fusion of anyons 1-2 (entangles the qubits)
#
# Physical realization:
# - Each sigma anyon is a Majorana zero mode
# - Braiding = physically moving anyons around each other
# - Measurement = bringing anyons together and measuring fusion outcome

ANYON Ising

# Initialize 4 sigma anyons (2 topological qubits)
# Convention: Pair (0,1) = qubit A, Pair (2,3) = qubit B
INIT 4

# Apply Hadamard-like operation to qubit A
# (In Ising anyons, requires specific braiding sequence)
BRAID 0

# Create entanglement between qubits A and B
# This is the topological equivalent of a CNOT gate
BRAID 1
BRAID 2

# Measure fusion of anyons 1-2 to collapse into Bell state
# Outcome determines which Bell state: |Φ+⟩ or |Ψ+⟩
MEASURE 1
