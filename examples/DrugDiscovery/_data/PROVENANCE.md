# Tiny DrugDiscovery Example Data - Provenance

This folder contains small, hand-curated CSV files intended solely for running the examples out-of-the-box.

- The molecules are represented as SMILES strings.
- The included SMILES strings correspond to widely known chemical structures and are provided for demonstration.
- No experimental measurements (bioactivity, ADMET, etc.) are included.

If/when we add a downloadable "real" dataset, it should live behind an explicit downloader script and include an upstream license + citation in this folder.
