# Tiny Fraud Example Data - Provenance

This folder contains a tiny, synthetic, hand-curated transaction dataset intended for running the examples out-of-the-box.

- The data is not from any real payment network.
- Any similarity to real entities is coincidental.
- Use this only as a smoke-test dataset.

For realistic demos, add a downloader script that fetches a well-known public dataset and records its upstream license and citation in this folder.
